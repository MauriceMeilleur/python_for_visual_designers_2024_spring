# print 'hello world' to the console

# print() is a function, indicated by the parentheses that follows

# 'hello world' is a string, indicated by either single or double quotes (Python doesn't care as long as they match)

# by placing 'hello world' inside printâ€™s parentheses
# we feed the string to the function as an argument

print('Hello world!')
