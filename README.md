## Zine
Everyone is encouraged to contribute 6 pages/3 spreads for the class zine. I’ll make it available in .pdf once the course has concluded. Format is A5 portrait with full bleeds, and the submission deadline is 2 April. [Drawbot templates»](zine)

Past zines for inspiration (these are all from David Jonathan Ross’s students in this course):

## Credits
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Just van Rossum (who taught me how to write code in Python!), Andy Clymer, and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/), all of whom have taught various versions of this course for Cooper. The structure of our course this session closely matches DJR’s approach, and we’ll be using a lot of his code.
