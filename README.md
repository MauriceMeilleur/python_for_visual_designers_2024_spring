## Credits
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Just van Rossum, who taught me how to write Python code; Andy Clymer; and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/), all of whom have taught various versions of this course for Cooper. The structure of our course this session closely matches DJR’s approach, and we’ll be using a lot of his code.
